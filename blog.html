             <h1>Build your Brand:</h1>
            <p>A thoughtful, deliberate blogging strategy can help you nurture customer relationships,<br> generate recurring inbound traffic, and give you a way to promote new products and services<br> while building your brand.

Blogging also gives you room to get creative with different types<br> of content, tell customer stories, educate readers, or target key words and phrases to help your <br>website rank higher on Google. 

Blogs can be extremely beneficial to your business, but many<br> ecommerce sites struggle with blogging because it takes time, care, and effort to get it right.<br> Simply publishing a few posts a month isn’t enough to regularly bring traffic to your site.<br>That’s why we’re going to take a close look at some ecommerce blog examples. We’ll go through<br> the topics the blogs cover, how they relate to what the shop sells,and what each blog<br> does well. These blogs all have unique strengths that will help support you as you develop your own,<br> no matter what kinds of topics you’d like to cover or what format you’re going for. </p>
